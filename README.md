## Hi there 👋

Reaching the end, with my own will.

### Who am I?
Just a Chinese senior high student which is willing for changes.
Maybe ... I should create my own opportunity?

### 人民群众才是历史的主导者，开源社区是人民群众的理想公社之形态

任何企图破坏开源社区、开源精神乃至人民大众之团结的行为，都是非正义的反动行径，他们必将彻底失败，阶级统治必将彻底废除，而团结起来的人民将是战无不胜的。

### PEOPLE IS THE ACTUAL LEADER OF THE HISTORY. OPEN-SOURCE COMMUNITY IS THE IDEAL FORM OF THE COMMUNE

Any ideas that willing to break the open-source community, open-source spirit or even the unity of the people is injustice and reactionary. They are going to be failed completely and the united people won't be defeated.
